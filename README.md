# About

* This is a reimplementation of paper [Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03981) using Matlab Built-in deeplearning toolbox
* The [original version](https://github.com/cszn/DnCNN) uses Matconvnet


# Requirements

* Matlab R2018a only

# Usage

1. set up your configurations as in main*.m
2. use `Project.run_project(opts)` to run the project


# Todos:
1. Fine-tuned network models
2. more experiments on different training options

---

Have fun fine-tuning :)
